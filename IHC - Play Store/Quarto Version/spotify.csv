"The app is fine, works well enough. The only frustration I have is that the filters used to be retained when I'd back out of the page for a podcast. I want my filters to always be on unplayed, not all, and with recent updates, I have to change it back to unplayed every. single. time. It's driving me batty. Please fix this asap. Also, things I've unfollowed are still showing up on my home page, with no way to remove them.",3
"I've used Spotify for years, and while I probably wouldn't ever use anything else, the amount of bugs and glitches that have been piling up recently when I use it is becoming overwhelming. It seems to struggle going between online and offline, which doesn't make sense because all my music is downloaded. It also struggles to play through my Alexa dot then to my car or other Bluetooth things. It's getting rougher and rougher around the edges, but it's still the best one.",4
"I'm changing my review to one star until the new ""resuming your [playlist name]"" voice is no longer part of the app or until there is an option to disable it in settings. Please fix this asap. Every time I get in my car the song I selected always disappears after the voice as well. I've been paying for premium for the last 8 years of my life and I'm considering leaving because of this change. Also side note, update where the ability to speak into the app to play a song was great. Now I can't.",1
"Spotify used to be my music app of choice, but now it crashes constantly, and whenever that happens the song I was listening to starts again from the beginning. So in order to hear the next song I end up having to use up all 6 free skips if I use it long enough. If it didn't crash, I'd increase the rating, but even before that there have been wayyy too many ads. Youtube Music app doesn't have nearly as many ads and you can select which song you want to hear next. Please fix the crashing!!",2
"Spotify used to work well, but now its performance is abysmal. Often freezes and no options work when chosen. Separately, even when connected to a network the app will still stay offline. To be clear, other apps will be working just fine, at the same time. Just renewed premium again, but it may be my last, due to all of the software problems. With the cost of the subscription, it must at least work well.",2
"The experience keeps getting worse. The latest is a loud and obnoxious computer voice saying ""Resuming blah blah blah playlist,"" every time I come back to the app. Why? Who thought this was a good idea? Adding to that, when I come back after being in and out of service, it often resumes the wrong playlist (which I now hear announced). Finally, there have been an excessive amount of random UX/UI changes (with liking/saving songs & playlists) making usage unpredictable. I feel like a beta tester.",2
"The Last several months, it randomly stops during a song and closes the app. It will restart the song at the beginning, if I go in and press the play button. It is very frustrating to not be able to listen to my Playlist while doing other activities. I have made sure that the app is updated. It also seems to play 3 sings than an ad. It used to play longer...this was my #1 music app our no longer worth the trouble.",3
"Overall, it's been a great app. The glitch where it automatically starts playing through my Bluetooth devices though, even when I try to stop it, is really annoying. Push pause, 1 second later it plays. Push pause again, it plays. Rinse and repeat. Go to close out the app entirely, realize Spotify is not even open on the phone to be shut down, and yet, somehow it is still playing. Super frustrating.",3
"I have ALWAYS had issues with spotify stopping a song in the middle, and having to completely restart the song. It has been an issue on my PS4, on my old phone, on my new phone, on my desktop, on my TV. It is a universal problem that I have. I know the response is going to be 'delete your entire library of downloaded songs, and the app, and re-download EVERYTHING and that should work perfectly' I have. It doesn't fix it. I am paying for this service and it's incredibly frustrating",1
"It has basically every song I've ever loved, recommend it as a streaming app üëç HOWEVER I cannot choose a song to start with on my phone, or turn off shuffle, or skip a song more than 4 times. I also get an plethora of ads on a daily basis. But the thing is, I have none of these issues on my laptop nor tablet, although I still get ads they are in smaller groups so it is much more bearable. If you're going to have it one way on certain devices, please make it uniform across all. Thank you :)",3
"Great app for podcasts, audio books and music...but...please please please include an option to ""stream over WiFi only"". This app uses a ton of data and there is no way to restrict the usage automatically. The app only has a toggle for ""offline"" mode but that restricts ALL data (including over wifie) which is a huge pain to keep up with. For the price, I'd expect a basic feature like this to be integrated.",4
"If you're looking for a new music app, get literally anything else! It used to be good, now the only reason I still use it is because transferring my liked songs would be a headache, I'm more a hostage than a user at this point. It's become extremely laggy, my guess is they're too cheap to buy more servers, causing slowness during peak hours. I recently timed how long it took to open the app, select a podcast from my favorites, and start the most recent episode: a minute and 40 seconds!",1
"Can't even listen to an album anymore; it instead makes a Playlist with random songs from not even the same band that I can't control. Why would they implement that? How is that supposed to make me want to get premium? And to top it all off, I have to listen to several ads after two or three songs. And I can't even look up each song from any album individually; it just does the same dumb Playlist thing as it does for albums. I'm deleting Spotify and switching to another app.",1
"Easy to use but deletes your liked songs unprompted. I've used this app for years and can say the premium is worth it. However, there have been a few occurrences where the app no longer has songs liked in your playlist. The most recent time this has happened is today, 04/18/2024. Unless you have an immaculate memory, the chances of getting all your liked songs back are very slim. Hopefully, they will change this bug, or I may have to cancel my account and try another music streamer.",2
"While I like the app, I almost gave it 3 stars strictly for its terrible ""shuffle"" technology. I listen to the free version for now (I've had the lay one before) and so I don't mind the ads. In free version if you listen through your phone app, you can't play your music lists straight through, only on shuffle. That's fine too, no need to give the best version for free. But my goodness, can the same song not play another 1 or 2 times before playing the whole list through?!",4
"I thought the ads were already to much- but now, the ads are far more than excessive. It used to be a thirty second ad, then a ten second one. But now they're both thirty. And, whenever I leave an album, a Spotify premium advertisement shows. Then, it crashes and I'm now face-to-face with my home screen. Some of the lyrics don't have an apostrophe in the words. E.g. ""youre"" kind of gets on my nerves. Now shows McDonald's ads. Find another music app, I'm sure there are better ones.",3
"I have never tried to resolve a storage issue with Spotify and not had it fail catastrophically. I store my music on my SD card, every time. So why will the application randomly decide to set it to Internal. Every time I try to move it back, Spotify says it will ""Restart upon completion"". It never has. The way I get it to work again is by Uninstalling the entire app, and re-downloading everything. I'm tired of doing this every few months. App support for Android feels non-existent",1
"I didn't know how spotify could make it any worser, but they did. Not only can free users no longer skip songs more than 6 times again, but they've made playlists UNBEARABLE. It's on a shuffle, no picking specific songs (for some dumb reason), and you can't go back. My playlists are now useless. I guess spotify really hates people who don't buy their subscriptions. And on top of all of this, they still have those damn ads as if it was a middle finger after a slap in the face.",1
"I've never had a problem with Spotify in all 10 years that I have been using this app, however after the last update my music keeps stopping for no reason and the rewind/fastforward feature is glitchy. Other than that I live for this app. It's literally helped to shape the person I am today by showing me new music suggestions over the years and suggesting events in my area by artists I play! That feature has been the most useful thing on my phone and I had a few amazing nights because of it!!",4
Terribly broken app. It plays music and that's about it. If it's connected to Bluetooth or Alexa speaker the lag is insane. You won't be able to skip songs or pick different songs. The only option you have to play what you want is to manually add the song to your queue and wait for the song to finish. Thinking about switching to Apple music because I've been having this issue for years now.,2
"It's an amazing music streaming app, with probably the widest selection of songs I've seen. The sound quality is great, and it's overall awesome, but, I have a couple issues. I don't like that if you don't have premium, you basically can't do anything. You can't loop songs, can't turn shuffle on or off, and Spotify adds things to your playlist automatically. While I can deal with the lack of freedom, I hate the ""we added"" songs. Just let me have my playlist as is.",4
"Mostly works fine. But this app sucks with audio books. I don't get it, with music albums I have no problem but with books, at the end of a chapter the play time will say 10:23 or something when the track is only 9 minutes long and it just keeps counting up with no audio. Then the app acts like it's loading but won't ever do anything and sometimes it'll say it's in offline mode. If I reboot the app it works fine again until the end of the next track.",3
"This is an update: it's worse now because I can't even play just one song that I find. It plays a totally different song than the one I selected from a whole set of songs that come up on. You tube is better. I like the fact that it plays on my phone when I am using it but lately, I have disliked the fact that songs are being added to my playlists and are being played automatically which I can't skip. If I wanted those on my playlist, I would have added them myself. I am going back to you tube.",1
"If you want to pay for premium to get rid of adds and shuffle, don't bother. You still get adds, annoying ""what's new"" pop-ups, concert reminders you never asked about, and shuffle will be turned on automatically. And before someone says customer service, they're useless, don't actually understand the app or care about the issues which have been going on for over a year. I've only stuck with spotify because i don't want to rebuild my library on another app, its too big.",1
"Recently, Spotify has made a change that plays a robotic voice track with the message ""Now resuming [name of playlist]"" when moving between audio devices (from phone to car radio, car radio to headphones, etc.). This is INCREDIBLY ANNOYING and there is no option anywhere in the settings to disable this. So, I'm forced to voice my displeasure with this ridiculous ""feature"" with a negative review, and I encourage other people to do the same until there's, at a minimum, an option to disable it.",1
"It's a decent music app. Downloads and the device's internal communication could really do so work. If I play an album I've downloaded, it should just play from my device instead of using more data and possibly lagging from low phone service areas. *edit* its gotten worse over the years. Constantly have it remove my albums even though I have all the proper settings and the current versions. Very expensive and annoying to deal with",1
"Had premium for a few years, but recently had to cancel temporarily to save money. The first day back on free, my entire commute was ads. The entire commute. Before any songs could even play. I also can't pick a song to play anymore, it's forced random. This is all just insane, and I don't want to support this practice. Run, go anywhere else",1
"This app frequently ""stops"" playing music. What it's actually doing is playing songs beyond the end of the song. Imagine a song that's 3 minutes long, then imagine the song ending but the playback timer going beyond 3 minutes... infinitely. I've gone back to my app (after forgetting to ""turn off"" my non-existent music) to find the playback time at 22+ hours. If music stops unexpectedly, I have to go back to the app and force the next song (or restart current song.) This happens frequently.",1
"Why spotify feels the need to pump ads despite paying for premium is beyond me. I love the music player for the most part, but podcasts are incredibly painful to listen to beyond one episode. You'll be hit with ads for other podcasts that have absolutely nothing to do with the one you're listening to, and you'll have to go into the app to click the next episode because it's likely going to replay the previous one you just listened to. Please fix it. It's not just the app, but the model itself.",2
"I loved this app because the autoplay feature for picking songs and letting it play other tracks based on the track I picked. It was a great way to find new music while I was driving, but for several months, when I connect to my car's Bluetooth, all of the tracks I choose get stuck on repeat and it won't allow me to turn it off. Now amount of uninstalling, clearing cache, reinstalling, etc. has fixed it. I'm on the verge of canceling my subscription after 4 years. Garbage app.",1
"Works OK, not great. Songs are constantly being changed (like a song that I liked becomes something different somehow), songs randomly unliked, shuffle is terrible (both regular and smart shuffle), song radio stations are not good or follow that song theme. Just all sorts of not user friendly options. Hoping they finally figure it out, but don't really have faith in them at this point. Will be looking for a better option if they don't fix things....",2
"Overall, it's a great app. While they do play a lot of ads in quick succession, it is only once per 7-12 songs. And I would much rather have a bunch of ads grouped together than have 1 ad after every song. The one thing that I don't like is that you can't loop just one song that you like on the mobile version. Another thing, spotify automatically adds songs on the mobile version, and I don't see why it does that.",5
"Please Disable ""Now resuming... playlist."" Not only does it disable shuffle so I have to turn it back on, but it just feels tacky and cheap. I thought I was paying for a premium product. I know what playlist I'm on, there is zero need to delay me listening to my music by playing some audio clip. I swear, with each update I get closer and closer to deleting my account and getting out my old mp3 player.",1
"Honestly this app is really frustrating. The only way it's actually usable is if you pay for the fee, and if you don't Spotify gives you no control over what music you can actually listen to, you can't listen to a specific song you want to or even skip too many times, and the ads are so frequent and lengthy that they have ruined any enjoyment I get from this app. I would like to actually listen to music, not be advertised to constantly. I would like to be able to look up a song and hear it.",1
Spotify is a great app I just think from personal experience maybe not all that ads. And there's a lot of glitches but that might just be me. And for some reason it says I'm following more than what I actually am. It also won't let me change the background picture of some of my playlists But other than that this is a great app I would recommend. Oh and maybe just a little bit more lyrics To more songs.,4
Update: I hate the music video feature when music plays. Just leave it alone!! First let me say I LOVE Spotify - I can listen to music. But it's becoming cumbersome. It tells me I'm in offline mode when I am not. I updated it and still says I'm in offline mode. I uninstalled and reinstalled it - STILL says I'm in offline mode. I went to settings and I am not in offline mode. All week. Which means trying to listen to music has been spotty- pun intended. Thanks though for being a üíú back.,1
"Spotify has steadily declined over the last ~2.5 years. The worst is their AI shuffle, which overplays songs you've heard 100 times and skips everything else. This can't be turned off. Songs will randomly pause and claim they're still playing. The ""download music"" feature almost never works when I actually don't have service and need it. Every time I open the app, it says I don't have internet and spazzes out. Use Apple.",2
"So, 5 minutes after my last review, I downloaded the new update hoping it would fix the problem of songs stopping while I'm listening, forcing me to start over each time it happens. It did not. This has been going in for at least a year, and numerous updates haven't fixed it. I don't know what the problem is, but I'm moving my playlists to an app where I can enjoy them. Smh.",2
"Stop reminding me about concerts and fix the app. I've been a spotify premium subscriber for years and this is embarrassing. The app goes to ""offline"" mode for no reason and refuses to load any pages. Sometimes the auto play is great and plays a random podcast after the one I played (what i want) but other times it repeats the same episode or continues with the next episode from the same podcast. I have no idea how to tell it what I want or why it behaves differently sometimes.",2
"The latest update is garbage. I can't conscience a 1 star as the recommendation system & podcast features are really good. But seriously, if more features like the bluetooth auto-resume & auto smart shuffle come out, I don't know how much longer I will be using this app. Seriously, stop implementing things that fix problems that don't exist. It's annoying.",2
"Added intrusive AI voice before it resumes playback announcing what you're listening to, like you didn't select what you wanted to listen to already??? No way to turn it off and it plays way louder than the following music. Unsure why they constantly make changes nobody asks for. The app is fine, just fix bugs and stop adding new ""features' that suck",1
I pay monthly so I can download music to listen where ever I go without having to use data. Constantly doesn't work and tells I have go connect to even look at an artists songs that I have previously downloaded. Absolute disgrace. Also why can't I look at my artists under downloaded...just gives me albums and Playlist. I don't like Playlist. I like to listen to an entire album! So over this and not paying anymore,1
App just keeps getting worse. 30 minutes of uninterrupted music is a flat out lie and grounds for a false advertisement lawsuit. I just had three commercial breaks within a span of 20 minutes. And now the app is auto playing every time I open it. I would delete this app entirely if it wasn't for the fact that it pays my friends the most out of all of them.,1
"Used to be good, now I have problems every single day. Won't play certain songs, doesn't sync with Google nest, offline content isn't available offline, they keep making it fancier and fancier and yet it is getting worse and worse with just playing music and songs. Updates don't seem to fix the big issues that I'm having either, definitely not worth paying money for anymore!",1
"Barely Functional. The app takes at minimum 15 seconds to react to inputs, will randomly stop playing music, and even at times will pick a song at random when my hand isn't even on the screen. On top of being barely functional, the app freezes up really badly and sometimes will take 3-5 minutes just to load up songs that are already downloaded on my phone. It's really cool how Spotify decided to raise their subscription price but the app becomes less and less functional with each new update.",1
"App has been great until they added a ""feature"" with an AI voice saying ""resuming [Playlist]"" when connecting to a car or another Bluetooth source. The voice is at a louder volume than the music, cancels the queue, and turns off shuffle as well. There is also no way to turn off this ""feature"". Online there are a lot of complaints about this change. Don't use paying customers to beta test half-baked ""upgrades"" just because someone on marketing wants a promotion without an option to opt out.",2
"I have been a premium user for years and I am frustrated with the shuffle function repeating the same songs over and over. Also instead of only using my recent listening preferences as criteria for suggested music, I would like to have the music suggested from my overall listening history, to avoid having it only suggest rap music simply because I've listened to that the most lately. In short, I want it to suggest more genres of music from my all time listening preferences.",2
"Edit: 6/25/2022 and still having the same issues with functionality. No responses or fixes offered. Edit: 4/9/24 and no responses to feedback or customer support. In the past two years. The only thing that convinced me to keep my subscription was that many audiobooks are ""included with premium,"" but they don't tell you that you only get 12 hours a month to listen. 10 more hours was almost as much as my monthly plan. What a joke. Now podcasts won't play. Will be canceling and moving to Amazon.",1
"Don't waste your money... Still a current issue is when I open it, the playlist is always on shuffle after all the updates. When I turn it off, I only get the first song. I have to select songs manually to hear them or have them on shuffle to have consistent music. I like this app the best out of the major apps. I feel that they have the easiest interface and wide section. I miss the Hulu package.",1
Someone else already mentioned one of the glitches (songs aren't flowing and instead stop and switch to another song before finishing). I can't even search up a song in a playlist of mine like I used to. The app seems to constantly play after 30 seconds or more after closing the app. Very buggy. I'll update from 1 star to 5 when they fix this issue,1
I used Spotify for a while now and it used to be great but it's been going downhill lately. The # of ads has increased and it's the EXACT SAME AD repeating like 5 times in a row! Also it seems like the ads don't pause the playlist anymore. Once the ads are over it's mid song. It's getting super annoying and making me not want to bother with this app anymore,2
"Awesome service. I really wish the app would stop reverting to internal storage from the SD card after updates. Turning shuffle off while on the actual song seems to confuse the app and stops the music when the song is over. I instead have to turn off shuffle from the top of the playlist and then go back to the individual song and start it over, and then it will go to the next song. It's a nuisance, but overall I still enjoy the app. This new update seems to have made some playability not work",3
"I normally love this app and pay for the premium service. I normally just use it to hear music I know I already like, but I have had consistent issues with the apps smart shuffle. It turns on all on its own and won't turn off even when shuffle itself is turned off unless I uninstall the app. My playlists are normally chaotic, but I despise getting the ""recommended"" tracks which have little to nothing to do with the actual artists I listen to. Especially 3-4 at a time. It's a flow-killer.",2
"Overall, this is a great service with a good app. Lately is has been crashing on my Pixel 7 Pro as well as falling offline, even though I have a strong data signal. My only other feedback is that shuffle play seems to be limited to created playlists. I am suprised even with a paid subscription I cannot shuffle all albums in my library.",3
"Genuinely an infuriating and needlessly annoying app to use. Unless you pay for Premium you can only listen to playlists in random order, and you can't pick a single song to listen to in full. Why?? Spotify has also made the genius decision to force add random songs into playlists so that you can't enjoy your own music. You're better off using any other music app or just downloading the music directly to your device, it's less of a hassle AND you actually get to pick the music you listen to.",1
"I've been using spotify premium since 2015ish... a lot of features have since gotten worse. The shuffle has started to seriously suck. And what songs are recommended to me are more and more trendy, not what I actually would like... not cool a while ago. They changed the way the song radio algorithm works, and thats been sucky since... I know spotify can do better Also, recently, the app gets confused with offline mode even when i have perfect wifi or data. Making the app slow af.",3
So bad on so many levels they lie about the 30 minute ad free listing can't tell you how many times I get ads again after only 5mins. I can't even look at songs on an album it's infuriating. I understand I'm using it for free but to not be able to see songs on an album is crazy. It's insane you can't even search a single song up and actually play it you just get a preview. The only way to listen is to add it to a playlist and even then they don't even play the songs on your playlist.,1
"Overall I enjoy the music playing experience but I wish there was more separation from podcasts or a way to switch between the two. It takes a lot of navigation to go between music and podcasts, especially in a vehicle (dangerous!). I do enjoy the bonus features like smart shuffle and the Wrapped summary at the end of the year",4
"These are bugs with the app and/or servers. Songs will finish but keep ""playing"" instead of changing songs (9m+ runtimes). While playing over Bluetooth songs will audibly stop playing while the timer is still going. There's issues with the servers where the ""app login"" functionality will leave other devices partially connected and non-working (claims signed in). More than two year later and the app still restarts itself once closed or going zombie state (only shows in notifications).",2
"I use Spotify more than iheart or even Pandora with some great playlists, however, lately I have noticed I can't like any more songs to add to my favorites list. And I have noticed that when I search for an artist or band I want to listen to the app gets 'stuck' meaning it plays the same songs over and over despite a band such as Queensryche having an extension library of songs.",2
"I've had to uninstall and reinstall the app due to a technical problem. The ""allow explicit content"" in my setting keeps disappearing. This has been happening for a while now and each time I uninstall the app and reinstall it, it appears and then disappears. I hate having to do that again because it takes time to download all my music that I've saved.",4
"The crashing appears to be fixed. Love the audio book feature and the ability to add to multiple playlists and see what i might already have it on. but it's now harder to just ""heart"" a song. Also, how can I get my algorithm to stop recommending Jada Pinketts'new book bc I'm not interested ----------- Fix it. It keeps crashing and reseting to the beginning or minutes back. Been going on for a while and have tried every recommended fix. It's not me. My phone. My network. Wifi It's. The. App",4
Update- my original 1 star review said the app stopped about a minute or so into every song. I had to pick up my phone and hit play and it started the song over every time. I had reinstalled and updated the app prior to this and was still having the issue. I have now reinstalled the app again and restarted my phone and was able to get it to play for about a half hour uninterrupted before I turned it off. I'll give it more time and use Spotify exclusively this month then give a final review.,3
"Whatever terrible software ""engineers"" decided to add a voice that says ""NOW RESUMING PLAYLIST"" EVERY SINGLE TIME I REOPEN THE APP, which I CANNOT DISABLE OR SKIP, needs to be fired and never be allowed to work on anything ever again. Also, the shuffle algorithm is HOT GARBAGE and plays the same 10 songs every time I shuffle my 400+ song playlist. I switched to Spotify from YouTube Music for the sole reason of being able to sort my playlist by artist, but honestly I might go back at this point.",1
"Literally never lets me listen to what I am actually trying to listen to. Goodbye Spotify, hello YouTube music! Lmao. Imagine losing touch this badly and having another app leech customers like this. Farewell, and never again. The Xbox app was the nail in the coffin. Ads being 3x louder than the music and freezing the entire app after a few ads, even though y'all responded and said itbwas fixed, it wasnt... Spotify has declined massively over the past few years. Time to watch the bubble pop!!",1
"Doesn't play the song I was trying to play for some reason? Also says I only get to skip six songs a day or something. Way too many ads. It gave me very few ads at first, then gradually built up to 2 or 3 ads after every 2 or 3 songs. Also keeps trying to get me to get Spotify Premium. ""We'll give you so many ads that you can't help but pay us to make it stop.""",1
"Let me be honest, I really like that the music it recommends me but sometimes it gets overplayed and I start to want new music recommendations. Also, I wish the whole app was free so I'm able to have offline music. Maybe once a year a user pays $67.99 for music? I'm not sure, it depends on how much you want. But still, I'd like my premium back.",4
"Please fix the shuffle issue with Android. I will put my music on and it'll start at one song. If I start it up the next day, it will frequently start at the same song as the previous day and play the same list of songs. A lot of times I need to use up my free skips because I just heard the same songs a day prior. EDIT: Lowering to 1 star. App will rarely get to an ad and not play it properly, getting stuck on it. Uninstalling the app does not fix this.",1
"Fair to say, it's worth it to have the Spotify Premium if you listen to it daily and have no desire to have ads constantly interrupting. With Premium, you get to play any time you want, shuffle, or not shuffle, and queue the songs you'd want to listen to next. However, without the Premium, it's annoying when ads are interrupting every after two songs, and even if you have over a thousand liked songs, it doesn't shuffle or play the other songs, and it's repeating the same song list...",4
"I have loved this app way more than any other music app I have ever used (and I've tried all of the popular ones). So much so that it's the longest running subscription I have paid for, which is getting to be almost 10 years now, and I don't intend to ever stop. Wide selection of music for every genre, mood or occasion whether you're listening to a playlist you created or one they've curated, you won't be disappointed. I highly recommend premium, affordable with worthwhile features",5
"I have autoplay turned off and playlists long enough to avoid the auto-adding of suggested songs. However, Spotify seems to think I have done this by mistake and is very intent on inserting actual garbage into my listening experience instead of just letting my playlists end or restart. It also sometimes plays suggested songs in the middle of playlists. I am generously assuming this is a colossal error and no human actually thought that programming an app like this would be a good idea.",1
"This app has begun to glitch. Guess with the price increase that is logical?? Anyway, the app has an issue on my Amazon devices. It plays a couple songs then stops. I have to tell the device to restart or hit play on my phone. I spent a long time chatting with ""support"". They of course want you to uninstall and reinstall. Or uninstall, shut off my phone for several minutes then reinstall. After talking to 4 reps I was in the same position as before. Frustrating to say the least!",3
"Why do they keep moving where the ""offline mode"" button is?? Just leave it at the top of the settings function. So unnecessary to move it around and within other menus. They've added a ton of cool features and the UI is great overall, but there's some wonky stuff here and there still. In particular tapping the shuffle button when a song is up has an entirely unnecessary notification pop up a long the bottom that blocks the queue/share/cast buttons.",3
"Ad breaks on podcasts make it jump to the next episode. Like each episode is split into 'chapters' but when a chapter ends, it jumps to the next ep. After googling this issue, I've found threads on the Spotify Community site and on Reddit that detail this issue going back FIVE YEARS. So I don't expect anything will be done to fix it. Really disappointing, guess I'll stick to Amazon Music.",2
"I HATE Spotify. I hope the company that made this AWFUL app sees this review. I try to listen to music, and it gives me some COMPLETELY different songs. I can't play OR switch songs in my ""Liked Songs"" Playlist, I can't rewind the music I'm listening to, I can't select songs that I want to listen to through my Playlist, only through the Search Bar! This app is terrible. Listening to music on YOUTUBE is better. I hope the Spotify company sees this and makes some changes. No Premium=No Music.",1
"The queue feature never works correctly, such as randomly removing 8 out of 10 podcast episodes in the queue, randomly mixing up the order of the episodes in the queue, replaying the same episode that just ended instead of the next one in the queue. The only reason I have the premium version is for the queue feature so it's really irritating that it doesn't work. Reluctantly switched when Google podcasts went away because it's the only other one with all the shows I like and it really sucks.",1
"You would think that a playlist would be easy for spotify to play IN ORDER but for some reason they can't figure it out and it's pretty annoying. Going backwards doesn't even work, you are supposed to play the thing that was just playing AND YOU GET THAT WRONG Reply to your reply: I'm not on free service I am paying for premium, and it's not just music it's also podcast that won't play in order and last I checked those should go in order on free service as well",2
"Unorganized, not an easy app to use for music or podcasts. I even have the paid version of this app. Hard to find even your saved or liked music / podcasts. Needs updated to be more user friendly and better organized. Will not order podcasts by recent uploads or unlistened to episodes for saved podcasts. Requires you to manually make playlists for songs you like and suggested songs are poor. Does not promote smaller artists. smaller podcasts or new to you podcasts incredibly difficult to find.",1
"Spotify is horrible if you don't get premium. You cannot even change the order of the songs, or skip around through a song. The ads are super long, and (this might be user error) I kept trying to play certain songs and it kept playing other songs! I would recommend getting a different music app instead of paying for premium.",1
"I loved the app before, but ever since, this is a new update I'm really hoping they put it back to how it was because I can't rewind my music anymore, when I type up a song I want to listen to it puts it in shuffle which makes it annoying because you can just listen to the song but u have to listen to other songs u don't want to listen to and then when I go to my liked songs and try to click on one it just gives me a piece of what it sounds like,it's like everything is on premium now.and the ads",1
"The app is pretty good overall but the shuffle is worthless. Only 10% of the songs in my playlist ever get played. If I take it off shuffle, the playback jumps back to the beginning of the playlist and jacks up the app to where I have to close it and restart. It shouldn't be that hard to just use a truly random function for shuffle.",3
"Original review deleted... one star because the offline mode never works. It is the only reason i pay spotify. 90% of the time, I turn on offline mode my downloaded albums still try to load, but i have no reception, and im in offline mode so it never works. I had to delete and reinstall the app, which got it to work for a week before it stopped working again. With no customer service, good luck trying to get help.",1
"It's a pretty decent music app, but it's not as good as it used to be. Now you need premium to skip and play a song in order. Come on spotify Where's the good old days. üò© Edit: The ads are freaking ridiculous. Every time I skip a song, I get 3 ads. I'm listening to Pandora from now on. I'm not paying for premium. This is ridiculous. I forgot to mention that the ads are a minimum of 10 seconds, and the ads are a minimum of 2. Edit: Came back and regretted it. I'm uninstalling.",1
"I've had Spotify for a few years, it is so much better when paying for it. It does glitch sometimes to where I need to close the app and reopen it (album art, and artist are not same as playing, when hitting next it lags a song behind) but works well again afterwards. I am only giving 4 stars because I wished they had a lyrics option. When that is added i will give 5 stars.",5
"Primarily use this for podcasts and their podcast interface is boggling! I don't understand why it will play certain episodes but not others. Can't find my shows in following easily, too pushy on new shows and premium. Pretty glitchy lately too, some episodes start to play on mute for some reason. Just doesn't make a lot of sense throughout the app... not easy to use!",2
"as I write this one star review of spotify via a great wifi connection, the app insists it is offline no matter what I try. conversely, if I know my connection's going to be bad and try to play downloaded music only, it spends 10-15 seconds spinning trying to connect to something for reasons unknown. great job. bandcamp works fine and actually cares about artists btw. re: spotify response: oh sure lol",1
"This app *AGGRESSIVELY* wants to auto start playing when ANY device connects to my phone. There are thousands of user complaints and threads about this. However, it looks like spotify refuses to solve this! Uninstalled and will not use this app until fixed. Note: uninstalling solved this problem. Now I can connect Bluetooth items without any sound until I say to, which is perfect! (Who wants your off-key singing shower hits playing when you connect to your car?!) FIX YOUR DARN APP!",1
"I've been using spotify for about 5 years now and had very few issues with it up until the last 6 months- year. I pay for premium but the last several updates have just been so bad. Bad Ui, constant and repetitive bugs, pop ups and visual promotions even tho I pay to use the service, bad algorithm changes. Sad to see the decline in this app and services while prices raise",2
"I love spotify premium and its great but glitchy lately. Ive had to restart the app repeatedly this week due to issues. It wont have the music play options at the bottom after switching apps , and when i try to click shuffle on a playlist or anything, cant get music to play from there, even restarting the app more than once. Another thing is sometimes im listening to my playlist and it randomly skips my song going into another playlist.",4
"App changed. Whenever my phone Bluetooth is connected to my car, Spotify will announce the name of my playlist before playing songs such as ""Resuming (name of playlist) or ""Resuming (name of album)"" or ""Continuing liked songs"". I don't want to hear this announcement every time I connect Bluetooth and just want the songs to start playing...",3
"This is my favorite app and it works really well even without premium but I have 1vpriblem and that is that fror most of the songs I listen to (System Of A Down, Falling In Reverse, and Mindless Self Indulgence) don't have lyrics. It's not that big of a problem but it's gets annoying because if I'm listening to a song and don't know what it said I will go to the lyrics but with my type of music (rock) it won't let me. Please fix this.",4
I prefer Spotify over pandora. I'm only asking for 2 things. More control over my personal playlists and more music than ads. Two songs. 4 ads. God forbid the song is over 5 minutes then 1 song 4 ads. And then I get the 30 minutes ad free and then I don't get the 30 minutes ad free. Seriously I get more songs from the radio. I know you are doing this in purpose to force us into premium. Quit being so shady.,2
"I don't know what happened recently but Spotify has become insufferable to free listeners. What used to be 3 ads between every 3-5 songs turned into five 30 second ads between each song. There's not even the ad at the beginning of your listening to gain 30 minutes of uninterrupted music anymore. Literally unbearable; I can walk all around my school and listen to more ads than music. I thought this was a music streaming platform, not some audible billboard. Lower your premium prices or fix it.",1
"I love spotify don't get me wrong but i hate how when you want to listen to a certain song it won't play that song, instead it will play songs that i don't even know and frankly, i wouldn't like to listen to other songs. I hate how spotify premium has everything, they can listen to any song they would like. But people like me who can't afford spotify premium, it gets tiring after a while. I hope that they change it back where we can listen to whatever we want anytime evn if there are ads.",4
"Service is fine, but the app is pure trash and not worth paying premium for. It's become terribly laggy and unresponsive, it crashes around the same time every morning, local files keep graying out and becoming unplayable, and every time I open the app to change the song it lags out and refreshes the UI and starts playing the previous song again. And now it has this annoying ‚Ä≥Resuming Playlist‚Ä≥ voice when you start the app, which sometimes just randomly changes which playlist you're playing.",1
"Terrible UI, there needs to be an option to block or hide content. I watched one episode of some popular braindead podcast and it's been haunting me ever since. *Second Edit: I contacted tech support, and the rep told me that there is no way to block an artist or podcast. Then proceeded to tell me to focus on listening to other content, because it's my fault the podcast is in my algorithm. This company does not care about the consumer's experience. $$$",1
"This app is wonderful and has made my musical life much better over the past two years. However a glitch started happening a couple weeks ago where, when playing two songs with gapless playback, it will skip over the last half-second of the first song and begin playing the next one. I listen to a lot of classical, Broadway, and other genres where tracks must flow from one into the next, so this is a real deal breaker. Once this bug is fixed I'll change my one-star rating back to five stars.",1
"i use this app nearly daily, and its okay. im fine with the free version, though i have had 6+ ads before. my main issue is the fact that in recent months, the app closes on its own and stops playing the song im listening to. it also restarts the song from the beginning. it's extremely annoying because i dont like having to listen to the same song twice, especially due to the error of the app. i have asked a friend about if they have this issue and they do too, so i know it isnt just my phone.",3
"Ever since Smart Shuffle was added, the shuffle button doesn't work right. Ex. I wanted to reshuffle a playlist, so: Press #1 Smart shuffle, press #2 unshuffled, press #3 normal shuffle. Half an hour later, I realize my songs are playing in alphabetical order, look at the app, and the shuffle icon is gray. üòë It's been months, just let us opt out of smart shuffle and fix the üîÄ button! Happens on desktop too! Why do I even pay for premium when y'all can't make a basic feature work? Do better.",1
This app constantly adds recommendations I don't want to a Playlist that is not close to being finished. Every couple songs I get recommendation I don't want. I can't find the option to turn it off Update- the continued forceful recommendation of random songs into my user created Playlist has turned me against apotify and now hate it and can't wait for a new app to replace it. Why the hell would you take away the option for me to choose if I want the app to recommend it? Terrible application,1
Best music app there is! Tons and tons of choices! However it has its many glitches and shutdowns. My Spotify account in my Amazon Fire HD 10 is glitching AGAIN due to the latest update! It was fixed just a few days ago with a new update and then this morning updated it with a new one and it abruptly shuts down! What are you guys doing??? I love listening to my Spotify on my Amazon Fire HD 10. 2 stars for now,2
"Sadly, I cannot give Spotify more than one star until Musixmatch is gone. Not only is Musixmatch filled with bugs, incorrect lyrics, and incorrect syncing of lyrics, but regularly it will have a completely different song, and I have never seen it match the artists' official lyrics. It genuinely shocks me that a company that fails to get the artists' words correct, provide a decent customer experience, or provide any recourse to help solve these issues has anything to do with any major company.",1
"I really enjoy this app. The only downfall is that it automatically plays music when I start my car. Even if I have closed the app out beforehand. If I forget and it starts playing, I'll pause it and close out the app. The same day, after not opening the app manually, I can get back into my car and it automatically starts playing again.",3
"Seems to have fixed the issue with only loading the first hour of my playlists. but now, when I use smart shuffle, it restarts my playlist from the most recently added or played songs everytime i try to add the song that's playing, it's not a huge issue on the longer playlists but on the shorter or newer ones it means I end up listening to the same songs over and over",3
Rather mediocre paid experience. Issue where podcasts will stop mid stream and start a different episode. Saved songs have issue loading when there is no phone signal ( isn't that the point of saving songs / pod episodes??). The amount of off stream ads during podcasts is ridiculous. I shouldn't have to hear off stream ads at all with a paid subscription.,3
"Service is great, the app itself sucks. The search function never works the first time, I have to erase and retype my song title about 8 times before my Playlist starts showing options that match (not me mistyping, it's the app not actively searching). On top of that, the app tries to use data to load my downloaded Playlist causing Long buffering pauses when I don't have good service (I'm a raural mail carrier so this happens a lot). Love spotify as a music services but the app's really lacking",1
"Spotify is virtual unusable if you don't have premium. There's all these weird rules of what you can and can't listen to. The only way to use premium is if it's connected to a console. On console, the phone let's you listen to any song you want in any order/whatever order you made if it's a playlist. Why can't I just listen to music with ads? Why do I have to listen to a whole playlist to listen to one song half the time. Either make the system similar to console or make it cheaper 5-7$",1
"1. I'm not allowed to listen to just one song, I have to listen to the entire playlist for that one song 2. I get ads every song, even in the middle of songs! 3. It won't even play songs from my playlist, it will play other songs from other playlists though. This app sucks for free. also can you like actually play songs in my 24+ hour playlist instead of playing songs i have blocked",1
"I don't know how many times I can suffer through this in silence Spotify. There are more ads then there are songs played and whenever a song magically makes an appearance it's never one in the playlist I'm listening to... Best way to describe Spotify is a completely unusable app without premium. Genuinely, it's amazing that I can get 5 one minute ads back to back but can't even listen to one of the songs in my playlist. Corporate, I think you accidentally put a song in my ads! (Gonna KMS.......)",1
I love Spotify and have used it for years. And ads are a given if you offer something for free. Thats not why im upset. Im upset because I'm sick of this app shuffling the same 20 songs over and over. I almost never am able to hear more than half my playlist. And sometimes I have to listen to the same songs at least 3 times a day. It seems that Spotify is reshuffling the playlist after every single ad and after every single time you open the app. It is so frustrating sometimes.,2
"PLEASE for the love of my mother, PLEASE get rid of the ""resuming"" voice clip. I don't understand why this was added in the first place. It ruins my flow of music, disables ""shuffle"" and just is distracting all together. Isn't the point of paying for PREMIUM to have UNINTERRUPTED music sessions?! Awful, just awful feature to the platform and I don't even want to be subscribed anymore.",1
"It plays songs that are not on my playlist when I am playing my playlist. It is getting annoying, and I am going to end my subscription because of it. And the only songs it does play from my playlist, play over and over again. They will also take your money. Make sure you cancel right before month 2 because they don't want to give your money back if month 2 goes through. I'm currently battling them right now. Horrible experience with spotify. Never get this app. It is horrible and their services",1
"Premium User. Not a fan Smart Shuffle. Sometimes I like to listen to my playlists on shuffle, sometimes in order. They put Smart Shuffle in between, so in order for me to turn off shuffle mode, I have to skip over Smart Shuffle (which loads incredibly slow). Inconvenient. Would be nice if I could just turn it off in the settings. Oh, well. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",1
"I would give this app 5 stars, but I've recently been having an issue where my app just simply stops working after I go to a different app or just close out of it. It's starting to get annoying since I like doing other things while I have Spotify playing in the background, but I can't when it just doesn't work. Idk if anyone else has this issue, but I'm starting to get annoyed with this issue I'm having.",4
"been with Spotify since '18 and have had nothing but a good time. The issue I'm having as of late is the connectivity. Everything works as it should until I get a call. When I end the call, Spotify starts playing through my cell speaker while my other apps and browser still play through my ext speaker. I have to restart my cell or the app in order for Spotify to play through the speakers again.... Hope there's a very simple solution. Cell - moto g stylus 5G (2022)",4
"It's a great app, all things considered. What I can't get over is the shuffle. It's really bad, like whenever I'm listening to rock, it switches to rap, and it just ruins my listening experience, I also hate the custom Made For You Playlists, Spotify-created Playlists used to be a way for me to discover new music but now it's all the music I already listen too, lame. I think Spotify fixed what wasn't broken, and it ended up breaking it even more.",2
HIDE SONG FEATURE BROKEN. HATE the new update. My shortcut is permanently frozen so i cant control the app in the background. Very annoying & inconvenient. Will use other apps til fixed. & i miss the previous algorithm. When I would select a song it would play songs specifically from that same time period or genre; now no matter what I play it shuffles the same 20 songs :/ pls bring back the old method. Doesn't make sense why I am playing a song from 1992 and the next one that plays is from 2023,1
"4 commercials to two songs always switches to a genre I hate only plays about five songs on a playlist of 108 continuous no matter when you turn it on. Wouldn't pay for a product that lies about giving you your own playlist then plays what ever it wants. For months now, why would I pay for something the radio offers for free since I don't get to select the songs after two of them. I've had it what is supposed to be a calming music options just frustrating. I'll go back to YOUTUBE!!!!",1
"It's your usual music streaming app. However, Im too broke for premium, and there are sometimes 4 ads after only 2 songs....and I'm not talking 10 second ads, I mean full on commercials. It's annoying. I know it's a ploy to make people buy premium, but at least let me listen to 5 songs before I have to listen to a whole 2 minutes of adds while trying to cry myself to sleep.",3
"I've been using spotify for years now, and today just made me snap. I get the video add, the one that says I'll get 30 minutes free from ads once it's done. I don't close the app, I leave my phone on, I don't even look at notifications. The first song didn't vibe, so I skipped it. ONLY TO GET FIVE MORE ADS. Nope. Unless this app can actually hold to their damn promises, I won't be using it again for a long while. This is ridiculous and I am tired of pretending otherwise.",1
"Love the app, let's me listen to all my favorite songs and podcasts while introducing me to news ones I never knew I liked...well, mostly as of recently I've been experiencing and issue with the Pc version of the app. There seems to be an issue when I try to view a podcast episode that has a video attached to it. It won't even play when I select the episode, yet it will play the ones without video no problem. Makes it irritating to try an catch up on my show without relying on my phone.",4
"I've been a paying user of Spotify for years, always liked the app, but now my podcast videos won't play if my phone is connected to my car. I take my lunch breaks in my car and used to watch my favorite podcasts sitting still, car in park (I don't watch at home). Now I'm unable to do so despite trying multiple workarounds. I'm not the only one that likes their audio to play through their car speakers! I hope this changes. I get the safety aspect, but give us adults a little more credit, please.",3
It is a pretty good app but after a certen period of time you can't start your playlist from anywhere it has you start from where you left off which is annoying. And it doesn't let you replay a song till you restart the playlist. Plus the 6 skips per hour for free is stupid because you can't really skip a song you don't really like,3
"Shuffle doesn't actually shuffle. It plays the same 3 songs in a playlist of 400 songs. everyday because it assumes that since you didn't skip it when it came on, you want to hear it on repeat instead of playing any of the other hundreds of songs on the playlist. This has been a problem forever and they're refusing to fix it. I'm not using smart shuffle and this still happens. You don't get above a 1 until you fix it.",1
"I pay for premium yet my partner and i still have issues. The app will often state that it has no internet connection, despite my phone having a strong connection to wifi. The only remedy I've found is to close the app and open it again. Random songs won't play off my ""like"" list, yet I can go to the artists page and it'll play no problem. The shuffle or smart shuffle don't work for my partner, it'll play one song and then stop. The updates in the last year have caused things to go downhill.",3
"I am legitimately about to find another music streaming service despite my 7+ years of content I've assembled on here. I have been on every help board I can find online and no one has a solution for the fact that Spotify automatically plays every time I open it if it's connected to Bluetooth and just blasts music in my ears when I'm not expecting it. Half the time it doesn't even play what I was most recently listening to, it just picks loud junk. As someone with sensory issues, this is hell.",2
"The amount of ads between each song is nothing short of phenomenal. One or two would be okay but there are 5-6 ads after I listen to 3 songs; that is, if I am able to listen to 3 songs before an ad break. Another prevalent issue is the app giving you ""30 minutes of ad free listening"" only to be a complete lie. There have been times where I have recieved an ad after the song that plays right after this promise of ad free listening.",1
"Ensh*tification strikes again. Used to be a great app, now it's total garbage. Can't listen to what you want without premium (which it isn't worth, thanks to their failure to fix bugs and half-@ssed features that have been a problem for years), forcibly auto-shuffles your playlist, forces you to listen to songs that are in different genres and completely unrelated. Spotify is officially trash.",1
"They continually add ""features"" no one asked for such as smart shuffle and most recently, a robot voice that says ""resuming (playlist name)"" which DISABLES shuffle and it happens every time you get in the car, sometimes, it happens while you're driving and skip a song manually. I'm laying for premium so I don't have ads and robots screaming at me and yet they continue trying to drive people away from their app.",2
"Really getting tired of the random problems that magically pop up. Everything was working fine until the update where they changed how likes work. Now my likes Playlist has a 5 second delay whenever I go to play a song. No other playlist/album does this. Just my likes. And now if I delete my search to bring up my whole library again, it doesn't return to the full list of songs. Just shows what I searched tor even though there's nothing in the search bar",1
"Spotify did something for the app to start up at random times! In the mornings, at work, in the middle of the night. ANYTIME! It's constantly waking me up. My kids hear inappropriate songs when I don't even use it for music. I use it for podcasts. I have a few people I've talked to who have the same issue. It is EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING. I will be deleting the app if it isn't fixed soon. I've been dealing with it for months at this point. And it's on my phone. I'm not even connected to a device.",1
"Stopped listening to NPR stations years ago after they misrepresented and misreported a topic I know very much about; Spotify continues to send me a notification to every single NPR release. At first I thought it would stop months later it didn't . I uninstalled and reinstalled, still getting 10x notifications a day. It's been over a year. I've checked 100 or so times to make sure I'm not 'following' and the 'notification' bell is not selected.. It's rather annoying to get constant notifications",2
"1 star until these weird not-optional features get fixed. 1) The unnecessary voice that comes on saying ""Resuming ____‚Äù when my phone connects to Bluetooth. 2) In addition to that, Spotify now takes playlists off of shuffle when that comes on. Get it together, Spotify. No one asked for this. (additional info: I have Spotify premium) Edit to add: I forgot! I'm also getting Spotify's ads mixed in during podcast ad reads. I should NOT be getting those too, since I have premium.",1
"UPDATE. I did the reinstall and it is not stopping randomly anymore, however I'm still trying to figure out how do I get rid of podcasts that I never intended to listen to. These podcasts clutter my selection and automatically start playing when an episode of whatever podcast I'm listening to ends. Is there a way to customize one's Spotify Podcast library, the same way one can remove music playlists ine no longer wants?",4
"UPDATE 2024: There is no simple way for a user to turn off autoplay when you plug your phone into your car. There is no way to stop spotify from integrating with Google Maps without your permission. There's also no way to turn either of these settings off. And before you respond, YES, I submitted a ticket, and it got me nowhere while making not a single difference for myself or anyone else. Basically, you really don't care about your users, and it shows.",1
"There is no longer a setting for enabling Car Mode. Now, I have to unlock my phone any time I need/want to skip a song, or I have to always have navigation open if I want to drive safely, which I DO. If this is a glitch, fine, if it remains missing, I will be canceling my premium membership and finding a streaming service that cares about car safety.",1
"4/4/24 - Spotify helped me with a new account. But it's happening again. UGH. A+ customer service, yet it's doing it again. I don't want to move my info again. :( it's a hassle. I use it for podcasts. I always start with the oldest episode & work my way towards the newest. I set the filter to ""Newest,"" so if I listen to ep. 1, next is ep. 2. Yet it keeps going backward to episodes I just listened to, no matter what I set the filter to. Reinstalling doesn't help.",3
"Always loved Spotify but premium is just getting worse, and I have a feeling it's due to us who use apks and things like removing the files. Still all those ads and the way it is without premium is just so unessisary people hate it because of that, you can't even select that one song you wanna play, the dumbest feature I've ever seen to pay for. You can get that on ANY other app well besides soundcloud and there weird premium + option for songs but yeah you see the point.",4
"I reinstalled just to rate it then I'm deleting it forever. The app starts playing music randomly (not pocket presses, it does it even when I'm not touching my phone). I'll stop the music, close the app and set it down and it still does this. I would rather have no streaming service at all than this garbage. Will likely remove my band's music as well.",1
"Used spotify since 2020, paying premium customer for four years straight, upwards of 2000 liked songs... And now almost at the point of leaving the app. Recently, a completely unsolvable glitch has appeared in which songs begin to have pauses and gaps like a scratched CD. NOTHING has fixed it and it is absolutely infuriating. For 12 dollars a month, I absolutely SHOULD NOT be experiencing things like this. Fix your app and lower your prices, since you are clearly not selling a quality product.",1
"It's nice and all. I use this app to listen to amazing music. But then again, the only thing at seems to bother me is the fact my playlist is forced on shuffle mode. Music should be accessible to everyone and not just people who have premium. I just want to listen to my music freely instead of being forced to listen to a song that I don't feel like listening too.",4
"I would call this app sub-par at best. Unless you want to buy Premium, you will have no way to rewind your songs; when you search up a specific song, you'll be forced to listen to several others before actually hearing the one you chose; you can't organize your playlists or even add duplicate songs anymore, and lastly you only get to skip five songs per hour and you get a very limited amount of time where you get to listen with mobile data. Unless you buy Premium, it sucks. Go with SoundCloud.",2
"I've had spotify for at least a decade and my biggest complaints are with the newer updates. The new + is frustrating to use when I'm just trying to bring back a song to the top of my liked songs (when I used to just press the heart twice) and recently everytime I open the app it plays a ""you're listening to spotify, continuing song"" clip which is annoying- especially if I'm in the middle of a song. If I'm paying for no ads, I also don't want this sad attempt at an ad.",2
"I've been using Spotify since 2010 and it's a decent quality music app with some fun gimmicky features. Music quality is seriously lacking though. Only up to 320kbps, which is disappointing when basically every one else offers better quality for a similar price. I'd probably go with one of those instead if you have good audio equipment. If you're just gonna be blasting music through a phone speaker or cheap Bluetooth earbuds though, Spotify will get the job done.",4
"Tablet only: NEVER USE THIS ON PHONE!! 1 STAR ON FLIP 4! Music alone, I subscribed to the nearest competitor for years. Never again. Tried Spotify free just once, and was hooked. Haven't opened that other app since, 3 devices. This beats every music app I have used in 20+ years of using them. Not a podcast person, so wasn't looking for those, but still stumbled on over a dozen I would like to try later. Saving last star for when I have used it longer.",4
"Car Mode was removed from Spotify on my phone, and upon asking customer service about it, I was informed that Car Mode was discontinued starting on April 17th and will be removed for all users eventually (it's being done gradually). I used Car Mode every single day on my drive to work, I find it MUCH safer for me to skip music while driving using Car Mode and the main interface to be rather clunky to use while driving. I'm highly unhappy with this change, bring back Car Mode",1
"I used to pay for premium, but now you can't play music without the app being open on the song the whole time. And they shortened my classical playlist into a loop of short content. If this app isn't going to work while I do other things on my phone, then I might as well use YouTube. At least they let you skip ads!",1
"I generally love this app and have for years, like it enough to pay for Premium even. Recently though I have been really upset with how it is operating with my Alexa devices. I used to play soft piano music all night for my baby to sleep to and also at nap times. It would play my playlist shuffled on loop all night no problem. But the last few days it will barely play 2 or 3 songs and then abruptly stop playing. Why the change? It's terrible.",1
App has gone severely downhill with 50+ ads.. even when you listen to ad to get 30 mins of uninterrupted listening it maybe gives you 5 mins 90% of the time. That alone is why I refused to pay for it as they don't have any integrity.. then it also suggests garbage music and flips to suggested stations even if I have it on Disney or a podcast it'll decide to change to something completely kid inappropriate or something with ads and it's annoying to constantly have to flip back to podcast.,2
"It's a good app for music and my go to but it hasn't been working and it doesn't let you pick the song you want to listen to it picks it for you and it adds ""suggestions"" to your playlist. It also only gives you 6 skips which is really annoying and doesn't let you rewind or restart any songs but it's great if you have premium or you pay",3
"I used to use this app for an alarm on getting up for work, but lately there has been more adds then normal. Whenever i go though my channels & switch them, every 2 there is an add & that is bs in my opinion since that never happened before. plus, when i pick my station/song to wake up to, its changed/has an add playing instead of the chosen song when my alarm goes off the following morning & that irritates me. Ik that i can get premium but now i feel theyer pressureing for the money now.",1
"This app was great before, worthy of 5 stars, but they just locked most features behind a paywall, and it becomes frustrating. If I want to listen to Electroman Adventures by waterflame at anytime, I have to use premium. Normal ordered mode in playlists is locked. You only get 6 skips an hour. You only get a sample when tapping on a song. This update absolutely destroyed this app. Thank God for YouTube.",1
"They keep taking away good features like playlist radio and Spotify Stations and replacing them with worse things. ""Smart Shuffle"" doesn't even work unless you use it on your own playlist. Even then, both ""Smart Shuffle"" and Shuffle are broken. It never actually shuffles anything. I have 1000 + songs on my playlist and yet I hear the same 10 songs on repeat with a suggested song here and there. I used to love this app but lately they just keep breaking things rather than improving them.",1
"Love the app, but y'all need to fix that repeat button turning on my default when I open any of my playlists. Clearing cache and reinstall didn't work. After the last update the repeat button remains on even after you close and reopen the app, and the ""play similar songs when your music ends"" setting doesn't work either. Music just stops playing.",3
"I struggle giving this app bad reviews because there isn't anything better, but for years on Android and iPhone....App is glitchy, UX is inept, offline doesn't work like humans need it to, have to connect to the mothership for everything, cumbersome to remove stuff from playlists or whatever name Spotify gives to things. Forcing me to use your nomenclature for categorizing music, playlists, albums, etc. very hard to find my music or podcast episode I was last listening to.",3
"App had 5 star rating. I pay for Spotify premium service and for some reason after 3-4 songs the app just stops. I mean wherever it wants to. In the beginning of songs, or about 2 minutes in and it just stops. Then I start the song over and it stops again. The only workaround that I see is to start the song in the middle, past the 2 minute mark then it will play. This is very frustrating. Is there a solution? If not, I might need to look elsewhere, which would suck. 5+ years",3
"Lately I've been having to toggle with either the Wifi or the Mobile Data for the app to stop tripping. It'll either say it's offline/ACT offline (no matter where I'm at, physically) when going to the search bar; when going to a playlist, the songs won't load immediately. It's getting really, REALLY irritating.",3
I love this app and while you kinda have to use premium I don't mind for the perks that come with it. However since the most recent update this app has been so buggy making it difficult to use. I hit pause and then 20 seconds later the song stops. I click another song and ten seconds later it'll play. Needs some work,4
"Every time I open the app as of this morning, Spotify overrides my music with a voice saying ""Resuming (last played playlist title, album title, etc). There is no way to turn this obnoxious feature off. Yet another awful change from a company with a series of anti-consumer changes. If you are shopping for a new streaming service, look elsewhere. Apple Music offers lossless streaming for the same price Spotify offers sub-320kbps quality. If I wasn't already attached to my library, I'd switch.",1
"Please bring the timer feature when you're connected to a different device (ex: Chromecast, Google devices as speaker.) Also lyrics on the same day a song drops. Please add a ""thumbs down"" feature. Especially to build a better DJ. The AI needs a lot of fixing. Repeat (auto loop) should NOT be a default feature that's on either. Please fix the auto loop set as default.",2
"Shout out to the Spotify API Team! Spotify developer is a perfect learning tool and so nicely organized, it helped me learn web api during tutorials. Keep up the awesome efforts Spotify!! Some albums are missing songs in the Album list available, example ""Clean Sheets"" by Atreyu. You have to search for the same Album name to find these hidden songs, they should just be included in the main Album list. Same name Album can only be found via a query of the same album name. Best!",5
"I have enjoyed Spotify for the variety of music selections and the ability to create my own playlists to fit my many moods, but I don't like that Spotify has randomly adds songs to my Playlists that they think I would enjoy. I create my Playlists for specific reasons and do not want other songs added. Because of this I am deleting my account.",2
"Needs an update BAD! Keeps force closing when I switch between different apps and stops/rewinds the song I'm in the middle of, it's been happening for about a week now. All my years using this on all the phones I've had, this has never ever happened. Hopefully a fix is coming. This is very asinine and frustrating",2
"Hi, Let's say I have 100 liked songs and another 100 songs in a different playlist. I played around 25 liked songs and switched to the playlist and played like 20 songs. Now, if I go back to liked songs, I am losing the streak, I have to listen to these 25 songs again or skip them continuously to play the next 75 songs. It's quite annoying to keep on listening to the same songs every time I switch. Please add a feature to keep track of songs played and continue playing from where we left. Thanks",4
I love the variety that Spotify has and that I can find a lot of the social media artists I discover on here. I wish there was a like and dislike button instead of a hide and add button. There are some songs I just don't like so being able to disable them from playing would be great. The hide button really only hides it from the current playlist you're listening too. Also it'd be great if this feature could be added to the desktop version too.,3
"The app has really turned itself around! For starters, if you search a song, you can listen to just that one song! That was a lot of people's issues back in the day, but now it's non existent here. Podcast that are only 20 minutes have a lot of ads, but as someone who doesn't use this app to listen to podcasts, I see this as a win. I think it's still a lil money hungry, but I think it's better than what it was.",4
"I've noticed that the app shutters a lot if my phone isn't open these days. It worked fine for many years, but I don't know why the app is starting to break on me now.. It certainly does not run as well as it used to. Really disappointing. The only reason I'm giving it two stars instead of one is because it ran fine for a long time, but not anymore. No reinstalls, no cache empties, nothing makes it stop.",1
"It's great for everything i want i wish more was available without premium, like downloading music. But i guess selfish people just want more money than they need. . . If you don't mind keeping your wifi on until kingdom come and of you can forgive the Ebenezer Scrooges of Spotify, the experience is a good one. Also i have 0 issues with it on my pc or other computer. It's only on the mobile devices that it becomes annoying.",4
"The app is okay, but it's playing recommended songs, ON MY LIKED PLAYLIST, I just want to listen to my music. And it's playing things in Spanish or Mexican. There's adds every 2 OR EVEN 1 SONG!? honestly, it's getting on my nerves. Sometimes, it says 30 min of add free music. But more adds. I just want it to be fixed.",3
"While you are listening to a podcast, sometimes it will change whatever you are listening to into one of their own personal podcasts that they produce, without any prompting or with your app even open. Spotify support denies that this happens and will not do any sort of investigation as to why their app changes what you are listening to. I can only assume it's done intentionally to bolster views on their poorly performing programs.",1
"Super frustrating. Even with a paid subscription, I have to listen to adds many MANY times during a podcast. A JRE podcast will have 10 interruptions. App will start playing in my car without even being open. I have to uninstall it to get it to stop automatically playing. There are no settings to stop this. Very annoying.",1
"Tldr: the app turns off when I want it on and turns on when I don't want it on I had tried working with support and they couldn't help. This app still drives me insane. PLEASE JUST ADD A STOP BUTTON so that the app doesn't just start itself when I turn on the the car. No matter what I do on my car in my phone or in the app, Spotify will start playing in my car on starting or after hanging up a call. I have forced shutdown the app and it will still open itself. The only thing to do is uninstall.",1
"The app is great! Works well, no bugs (for me), but I feel like it's not fair for people who don't have premium or have the family plan. Non-premium users have to listen to their music on shuffle. Of course, some people might not have a problem, but I listen to my music in an order. And when I found out Spotify didn't have unshuffle, I was pretty upset. Though, I do like how they give you an opportunity to try premium for free, and other than that, I don't have any complaints!",4
"Not Comercial Free even when you pay for it. There are always commercials before, during, and after podcasts and o pay 10.99 to not have commercials and yet here they are anyway. Another one that needs to be reported to Google. Also it has been the last few months losing my place on podcasts, instead of going to the next one it plays an episode at random. Fix that and maybe I'll give you another star.",2
"the app is great, i pay for premium, but why would you take away the ability to like songs? it's upsetting. i get all these random features that last for a couple days and then they disappear, too. its so weird. its whatever, though, premium is worth it to be able to loop songs and no bombardment of ads.",3
"The service is nearly 5 stars. The app is a solid 2 stars. The reason is lack of stability, reliability, and how it either auto plays without being turned on or it randomly goes into offline mode. ..of which you can't access in the free version. I have to reinstall it to get it to work. Devs supposedly have all this skill writing code and dev software interfaces.. yet, these apps never work as intended and require constant updates. Smh...",2
For the most part this app was not very good everything that a music app should have is on premium so the basic neccesities of the app you actually have to pay for. On top of that it is very hard to navigate and it is very hard if not impossible to listen to the song that you want to actually listen to. The only reason why I rated this 4 stars was because it had a lot of potential and I couldmt bring myself to give it a bad rating,4
"To preface,I use a free account. So I have shuffle and that I don't mind. What I mind is when I have a playlist playing it might my the same song twice and anothor song never. Also I don't mind recommend song but I would like to be able to choose whether or not it got played. Honestly with how these things are I would rather just not use Spotify.",1
"Good for music, but the new audiobook app, while it has great potential, is full of bugs. It stops every 3-5 minutes and occasionally jumps backwards to the beginning of a track. It also lacks the critical ability to drop a bookmark. It seems like there was no beta testing before launch. I expect better from Spotify.",3
This app is great on Xbox and computer... But on phone it sucks I don't get to choose one single song and I get ads after every video unlike Xbox version and computer. please fix this right now. Edit: it got worse I tried to play my playlist and it didn't even play any of my songs it just played suggested songs this app really sucks,1
"This app honestly sucks the way it was a couple five years ago was way better , I can't scroll down an album to look for a song anymore , it just plays the albums first song and if you don't like it you have to swipe hoping to not run into an ad until u find the song u wanted listen to from the album , as a person who doesn't want premium who's trying to save money this is super super frustrating, timing is everything and the way this works is frustrating I have to have the song liked to find it",1
"This has been great, but after the latest update, it just stops playing when casting to a speaker. I'm getting a couple of songs and then nothing, and it shows play, but the time on the ong isn't moving. If I get it to show the time moving forward, I still have no sound. This was not a problem until the last update. Have to constantly restart it as it won't play more than 1 or 2 songs. Is no good if the casting doesn't work.",4
"This app is horrible, I hate auto play. They need to get rid of it, Everytime I click on a song they play a different song then what I want to listen to and I have to click other songs playing different songs to find the one I want to listen to and when I turned off autoplay it was still doing that. And even playing all those songs just to find the one I want I can't rewind it back and it makes my history messy. I made a new account and it did thE SAME THING. UD RATHER PAY TO LISTEN ON YT THAN T",1
"Spotify's audiobook program is HORRIBLE!!!! First, I have to pay for premium to access the books at all. Second, it cuts me off half way through a book and demands I pay them for a ""top up"" to finish the book. I resentfully comply. Then, I wake up this morning and the app says I finished the book (when I hadn't). I back track and try to find my place. I listen a bit longer and then WHAM! Spotify says I used up my time again, and they want MORE money to finish this same book.",1
"Garbage, constantly crashes, Like we all know you're not paying the artists for their music, so the very least you could do is invest in the app. Like seriously the worst app out there. This app somehow lags even when in offline mode Also even when I have playlists downloaded, if I'm in offline mode it just won't load them at all.",1
"Anytime I switch my radio to Bluetooth doesn't matter what app I'm in Spotify isn't even on and it opens up and starts playing music. I'm trying to listen to YouTube or Instagram or something else doesn't matter I have to go find the Now opened Spotify app and pause it or close it. I'm trying to watch YouTube before Instagram or something else so this gets very annoying I am nearly to the point of canceling my subscription in uninstalling, maybe there's another music service that doesn't do this",2
"I'm-app and Alexa devices issues. It will constantly pause the music but say that it's still playing when I open the app. We use it on Alexa devices overnight for my son to sleep with piano music and this is a tedious issue when he comes in my room in the middle of the night multiple times because it's stopped playing. It will also often not play on my devices when I ask verbally, so I have to find my phone and get the song up then connect it to a speaker and then it'll play.",2
"It doesn't even work. I have an a10e, and when I try to click on a playlist, it says ""playlist empty"" how is a playlist with 800,000 followers empty? When I try to make my own playlist, I'll type in a song, click the song, and the app crashes. When I get back in the app, the playlist is nowhere to be found. Your app is completely broken for me.",4
"If you click to play a song, this app will follow that song with the same songs in the same order everytime. That is a phonograph, not an alogorithm. App is trash, and the algorithm is linear. It is also trash that you switch from devices, the app will delete whatever you are playing on the device that you are switching to. Gym music is different than drive home music. I have tried to cut a device off before turning the new device on...it still says listening to ""blank"" after 5 mins..Trash",1
"Spotify is the buggiest app. It lags on any device to load. It freezes when you change sources. It messes up Windows. 50% of the time, on a dozen new Android devices, it will grey out all downloaded songs when you have no internet. All my cars, all my running watches have no internet and I have music less than half the time. PLEASE REMOVE SMART SHUFFLE IT'S SO ANNOYING TO CYCLE TO REGULAR SHUFFLE EVERY TIME! STOP TELLING US TO VOTE! STOP FORCING THINGS ON ME! NO MORE RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOME!",1
"I can kinda deal with the ads, but my biggest problem is something that's recently accured within the past month or so; I've checked the settings just incase cause I've never changed them, or maybe there's a bad update that happened, but if I'm listening to a song and pause within the first 30 seconds to 1 minute of it, and leave the app then come back, the song gets skipped automatically",4
"I love it when it functions well...I despise it when it doesn't. Two biggest issues; 1. telling me I'm offline when I'm not and not loading things because of that 2. Related to 1. I download nearly 10 gigs off offline listening....that randomly stops working. First 10 or 15 seconds will play, sometimes nothing at all, before stopping or freezing. Wth did I pay for premium for when one of the biggest selling points stops working? Last time I cleared all the data and updated but...p.i.t.a. ....",4
"Usually I love using this app and have been a premium user for a while but ever since yesterday nothing will load. It always says it's set to offline even though I'm connect to the Wi-Fi. I've tried everything I can think of. I restarted, I turned off the disconnected to the Wi-Fi for a bit then got back on. But still nothing it's the same and rn I'm about to go to school without tunes. If this doesn't fix soon I will unsubscribe and delete app. I want help though and hope anyone has an answer.",1
"Spotify I hope this message gets to you. I wanted to like your App and use your service for listening to music and podcasts in one place but your App is so hard to use I never could. With the closing of Google podcasts I tried again, still too hard to use, just tried YouTube music app, miles better. I am sorry but I'm moving on.",1
"Edit 4-18-24: the lag has been insane, youtube and tiktok are loading but spotify won't play my music for a solid 30seconds after making a selection. (I do have premium, but me, my sister and my local gym have had the same issues) Let me dislike songs please! Or say dont put on my mix. I hate it when my sleep music gets put into my playlists!! Edit 1/12/24: the dont play button still does not work consistently.",1
"Typically I rave about spotify I absolutely love it because I do pay for the family plan. I also got so excited realizing that audiobooks were included in premium... however only 15 hours is included. You have to pay $12.99 for 10 more hours, at that point this deal is worse than audible from Amazon. I though I'd be able to replace my audible with spotify, but nope, audible wins here. I feel as premium we should get unlimited audiobook listens.",4
"Basically can't use the app without premium. For the first month that I had the app I had no problem but now I can't even rewind songs or skip more than 6 times without having to pay, and also when I try to play songs on my favorites it gives me a preview without even playing the song. Personally I think youtube music is better. At least I can listen to music on spotify. Absolutely money hungry",1
"I'm getting really tired of having to repost this review over & over. Why have you given me the option to turn off ""offline listening"" which downloads everything I listen to & fills up my phone space If it's just going to turn itself back on every time I open the app? Why is this ""option"" even there if it always turns itself back on anyway? I don't want it. It fills up my phone unnecessarily. I have to turn this off & delete at least 2 gigs of downloads EVERY SINGLE DAY. Fix this. Now.",3
"It has cool features, I'll admit. But due to ""licensing issues"" they will frequently delete songs from my playlists, as if I've never listened to them before, without notice. No graying out of the songs while keeping it on the playlist, even though they should have this capability. It's unacceptable and I doubt they're gonna fix it, based on the years of forum posts I've read indicating this has been a problem for years. Moving to Tidal, it has better sound quality anyways so good riddance!",2
